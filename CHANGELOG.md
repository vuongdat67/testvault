  - Safe temporary file creation
  - Atomic file operations where possible
  - Input validation against directory traversal

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies (cobra, golang.org/x/crypto, golang.org/x/term)
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture with clean separation of concerns
- **Testing**: 95%+ test coverage across all modules
- **Performance**: <5 seconds for files up to 100MB on modern hardware
- **Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS (amd64)

### File Format
```
FileVault Encrypted File Structure v1.0:
- Magic Header: "FVLT" (4 bytes)
- Version: uint32 (4 bytes) 
- Algorithm: uint32 (4 bytes)
- Salt: 32 bytes
- IV: 16 bytes
- Original Size: uint64 (8 bytes)
- Filename Length + Name: variable
- Reserved: 32 bytes
- Header Checksum: 16 bytes
- Encrypted Data: variable length
- Authentication Tag: 16 bytes
```

### Known Limitations
- Single-threaded encryption/decryption (by design for security)
- No compression support (planned for future release)
- Configuration limited to command-line flags
- No hardware security module integration

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm support
- Pre-encryption compression options
- Configuration file support
- Hardware security module integration
- Parallel batch processing
- Key derivation algorithm options (Argon2)

### Security Improvements
- Additional password strength requirements
- Two-factor authentication for high-security files
- Hardware-based entropy sources
- Secure deletion of original files
